# HackerRankProjects

Keeping a repository of completed HackerRank challenges for future reference. In general, these are meant to allow practice in Python, with a specific emphasis on using scikit and pandas for statistical analysis and machine learning.

| Project | Description |
| --------|-------------|
| predicting-house-prices | Using linear regression to predict housing prices. |
| stack-exchange-question-classifier | Using TF-IDF and Stochastic Gradient Descent classification to of Stack Overflow questions based on their content. |
| temperature-predictions | Using a gradient boosted regression method to interpolate missing temperature data based on date and historical data. | 
| the-best-aptitude-test | Using Pearson's correlation test to find optimal predictors for student GPAs. |
=======
Solutions to machine learning challenges from HackerRank, e.g. using linear regression to predict housing prices, classifying question topics based on metadata and text samples, and using a multivariate regressor to estimate missing temperature data.
